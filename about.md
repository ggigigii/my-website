I am a Masters graduate student at the Department of Economics at the University of Toronto. My undergraduate degree was a Joint Honors in Economics and Finance from Simon Fraser University. My academic interests are financial economics and econometrics.

This website will be used to present coursework covered in a wide array of field and core courses over my studies. You may find me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gigilin0/).
